# Floyd Algorithm

This algorithm is useful to obtain the shortest way between two points. A point is an element 
from a graph, the ways that separate a point from another point are the "lines" that join two points. 

This "lines" are unique direction and cost some resources or anything you want. The shortest way will be the 
"cheapest" way.

If a point has no way to another point, the cost is similar to infinite.

There is a Makefile in each version of the algorithm.
